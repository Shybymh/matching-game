Pick A Leaf is game made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I first made the game as an extension of a game I worked on during my Web Fundamentals course in my bootcamp. There were bonus challenges in the assignment. In order to learn and work more and get stronger in JavaScript I continued working on and made different versions of it. The game has 3 levels and restart option.
